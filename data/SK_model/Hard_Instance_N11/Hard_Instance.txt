N=11 and N0=10 (with one spin fixed).
p=5000, \tau=0.5, \Delta=1. (* Large p is needed to avoid fluctuations in Lyapunov exponents *)

p0=1000 for data storage

Data are recored in discrete time steps (x-axis),  s= k/p0, where k = 1, ..., p0-1.

Enegry levels are saved as differences, E_n-E_0, with exact ground state energy E_0 stored separately. 

The same for the MF approximation to E_0, it is saved as E_MF-E_0.
